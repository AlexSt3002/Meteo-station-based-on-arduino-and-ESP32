This project is a smart weather station designed to monitor and transmit real-time environmental data. It uses a combination of sensors and microcontrollers to measure key weather parameters and send the data wirelessly to a cloud platform for visualization and analysis.

Main features include:

Measurement of temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, and battery voltage

Wireless data transmission using LoRa or Wi-Fi (ESP32-based)

Real-time monitoring through ThingSpeak or other IoT platforms

JSON-based data formatting for efficient transmission

Solar-powered system with battery level tracking

Compatible with Arduino and ESP32 microcontrollers

The weather station is ideal for remote or off-grid deployments, offering reliable data collection and cloud-based access to environmental conditions.
